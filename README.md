The basic premise will be a turn-based battle game. The player will have 4 moves and the opponent will have 4 moves.
When the player or the opponent reach 0 health, the game ends.
There will be a play again button.
There is a modal explaining the game's premise. There is another modal that explains each of the player's move choices.
The opponent's move is chosen from an array. The array lists the same move multiple times to change the likeliness of a move being chosen. For example, confiscate gameboy is only listed once, but lecture is listed three times. Therefore, the opponent is three times more likely to use lecture over confiscate gameboy.
The four player moves will be different from the opponent's four moves.

Player moves:
Yell: deals damage based on the player's strength stat.
Plead: increases player's strength stat.
Cry: heals up to 50 health. Player's health is maxed out at 300.
Tantrum: deals a random amount of damage between 1 and 500.

Opponent's Moves:
Sigh: deals 10 damage
Lecture: deals 30 damage
Guilt Trip: lowers player's strength
Confiscate Gameboy: deals 100 damage
