The basic premise will be a turn-based battle game. The player will have 4 moves and the opponent will have 4 moves.
When the player or the opponent reach 0 health, the game ends.
There will be a play again button.
I hope to challenge myself by putting a modal into the game that tells you a story about why the player is fighting.
The opponent AI might just cycle randomly through the 4 moves. I might try to make it more likely for the opponent to pick one move over another, but that may be outside of my skill set.
The four player moves will be different from the opponent's four moves.

Player moves:
Yell: deals damage based on the player's strength stat.
Plead: increases player's strength stat.
Cry: heals up to 50 health. Player's health is maxed out at 300.
Tantrum: deals a random amount of damage between 1 and 500.

Opponent's Moves:
Sigh: deals 5 damage
Lecture: deals 20 damage
Guilt Trip: lowers player's strength
Confiscate Gameboy: deals 100 damage
