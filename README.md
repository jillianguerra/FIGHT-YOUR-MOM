The basic premise will be a turn-based battle game.
The player will have 4 moves and the opponent will have 4 moves plus one special "ultimate" move.
When the player or the opponent reach 0 health, the game ends.
There will be a play again button.

There is a modal explaining the game's premise.

<p>
There is a help button that displays a modal with instructions as to what each move does.
The opponent's move is chosen from an array. The array lists the same move multiple times to change the likeliness of a move being chosen. For example, confiscate gameboy is only listed once, but lecture is listed three times. Therefore, the opponent is three times more likely to use lecture over confiscate gameboy.
The four player moves will be different from the opponent's four moves.
